# Cylons

Collectively intelligent remote models which behave very much like models they are claiming to be. (Zero configuration SOA Framework).

Cylons lets your models in one Rails app, act very much like your ActiveRecord models in another Rails app, providing a base for a SOA infrastructure. I hope to be able to make it applicable to more than just AR models as well, however, I also hope to make it past cool proof of concept stage that works, but isn't exactly suitable for a production system, WHICH IS THE STATE IT IS CURRENTLY IN. You've been warned.

### Quick Explanation

Zookeeper (for now, only even though )
